Hello world!
This repo is just for saving my basic vim config from my .config/nvim file so feel free to use it if you want.
For the plugin installation, I used 'vim-plug' it is a minimalist vim plugin manager you can find in this repo https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug.
I only really touched the init.vim file where you can find the plugins i installed and some keyboard remaps i use
to feel more comfortable navigating vim. I leave comments on all the code for better understanding.

Thanks for looking up my repo, hope you find it usefull! :)
